      "description": "Understanding EMA {period} and its significance",
      "whatItIs": "EMA (Exponential Moving Average) {period} is a trend-following indicator that gives more weight to recent prices. It smooths out price action and helps identify the overall trend direction. When price is above EMA, it suggests bullish momentum; below suggests bearish momentum. The distance from EMA indicates how extended the price is from its average.",
      "aboveEma": "Price is {distance} points ABOVE EMA ({pct}% above). This indicates bullish momentum - buyers are in control.",
      "belowEma": "Price is {distance} points BELOW EMA ({pct}% below). This indicates bearish momentum - sellers are in control.",
      "touchCondition": "If price touches/approaches EMA",
      "touchReactionBullish": "In an uptrend, EMA often acts as dynamic SUPPORT. Expect a bounce upward. This is a potential BUY zone.",
      "touchReactionBearish": "In a downtrend, EMA often acts as dynamic RESISTANCE. Expect rejection downward. This is a potential SELL zone.",
      "breakCondition": "If price breaks through EMA",
      "breakReactionBullish": "Breaking above EMA signals potential trend reversal to bullish. Wait for confirmation before entering.",
      "breakReactionBearish": "Breaking below EMA signals potential trend reversal to bearish. Consider reducing long positions.",
      "tip20": "EMA 20 is best for short-term trends and scalping. It reacts quickly to price changes.",
      "tip50": "EMA 50 is the medium-term trend indicator. Institutional traders watch this level closely.",
      "tip200": "EMA 200 is the long-term trend indicator. A price above EMA 200 = bull market, below = bear market.",
      "tipClose": "Price is very close to EMA - expect a reaction soon. Watch for bounce or break.",
      "tipFar": "Price is extended far from EMA - mean reversion likely. Consider taking profits.",

      "title": "Trend Channel Guide",
      "description": "Understanding trend channels and boundaries",
      "whatItIs": "A trend channel consists of two parallel lines containing price action - an upper resistance line and a lower support line. Price tends to bounce between these boundaries. Channel width indicates volatility, slope shows trend direction, and R² measures how well price respects the channel.",
      "uptrendStatus": "UPTREND channel active with {strength}% strength. Price is moving in a controlled bullish pattern.",

      "lowerReaction": "Lower band = SUPPORT zone. Expect a bounce upward. This is an optimal BUY zone within the channel.",
      "breakoutCondition": "If price breaks out of channel",
      "breakoutReactionUp": "Breakout above upper band = Trend acceleration. New highs likely. Consider adding to long positions.",
      "breakoutReactionDown": "Breakdown below lower band = Trend reversal warning. New lows likely. Exit longs, consider shorts.",
      "tipUpperHalf": "Price is in the upper half of channel - closer to resistance. Be cautious with new long entries.",
      "tipLowerHalf": "Price is in the lower half of channel - closer to support. Better zone for long entries.",
      "tipStrong": "Channel has strong R² correlation - boundaries are more reliable for trading decisions.",
      "tipWeak": "Channel has weak correlation - boundaries may not hold. Use tighter stops.",
      "tipGeneral": "Best strategy: Buy at lower band, sell at upper band. Place stops outside channel boundaries.",

      "whatIsSupport": "A SUPPORT level is a price zone where buying pressure historically overwhelms selling pressure, causing price to bounce upward. The more times price has bounced from this level (touches), the stronger and more reliable it becomes. Support acts as a 'floor' for price.",
      "whatIsResistance": "A RESISTANCE level is a price zone where selling pressure historically overwhelms buying pressure, causing price to reverse downward. The more times price has rejected from this level (touches), the stronger and more reliable it becomes. Resistance acts as a 'ceiling' for price.",
